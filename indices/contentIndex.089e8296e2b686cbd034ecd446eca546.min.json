E.g. having servers in multiple countries for lower latency and \"decentralisation\". \n\n- DNS is fairly decentralised so there's not one single point of failure.\n\n- DNS is distributed to multiple servers that may control a separate TLD each. E.g. one for `.com`, one for `.org`, one for `.edu` etc.\n- There are multiple levels, `www.bbc.co.uk` would go `uk-\u003eco`.\n![[Pasted image 20220228112603.png]]\n\n- `www.` is just an identifier so people know that a hostname is for a website, it isn't actually needed when searching a URL.\n\n## The Internet\nThe internet is a group of interconnected networks spanning the globe.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-02T11:50:30.362181652Z","tags":null},"/notes/Dark-Web":{"title":"","content":"Themes: [[Networking]], \n\n# Dark Web\n## The web has *layers*\n![[Pasted image 20220721091415.png]]\n- The surface is indexed sites that can be found by search engines\n- The deep web is the sites that aren't indexed by search engines, much larger than the surface web\n- The bottom is parts of the internet that require specific software to access\n![[Pasted image 20220721091912.png]]\n\n## Onion Routing\n![[Pasted image 20220721092943.png]]\n- Data is protected with multiple layers of encryption, like an onion\n### The Onion Routing Project (TOR)\n- Tor is just the technology behind the dark web\n- The TOR browser is the most popular browser used to access the dark web\n\n- The Tor client will pick a random path to the destination server, this is so the route through the network is different every time - hard to track, not impossible though\n- The network can be exploited to deanonymize users, but this is very costly to carry out\n\n- The first node that you travel through can see your real IP (unless using a VPN), but the data is encrypted so they can't see what you are doing\n- The site can see the data but the client paths through at least 3 nodes so it can't see your real IP address, if the site doesn't care about anonymity (like Facebook) they won't go through 3 nodes\n- Anywhere in the middle can't see either\n\n### Dark web sites (Tor hidden services)\n- The service has no knowledge of the IP address of any visitor\n- Visitors have no idea of the IP address\n- Tor sites have a `.onion` domain extension and often have obfuscated addresses `tnhafie5wfu6qjby2ucxiedh.onion`\n- The addresses are generated from the key used to encrypt the site\n\n![[Pasted image 20220721095800.png]]\n\nHosting a site on Tor is much cheaper than on the clearnet because you don't need to buy a domain, you can also host the site personally because your IP address is anonymous\n\nv3 onion addresses are 56 characters long which are harder to brute force than v2 (16 characters)\n\n### Tor bridges\n- Bridges are a workaround for when your ISP blocks Tor\n- Could use a VPN instead but the Tor network is slow enough as it is so it can become unusable\n\u003e \"Generally speaking, we don't recommend using a VPN with Tor unless you're an advanced user who knows how to configure both in a way that doesn't compromise your privacy - Tor FAQs\"\n\n### Options for accessing Tor\n![[Pasted image 20220721101713.png]]\nTAILS is anti-forensic, the moment you power the system down, all traces of it are gone, all data is tunnelled through Tor.
