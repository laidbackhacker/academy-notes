# Decentralised Internet Platforms
## Invisible Internet Project - I2P
- Very slow
- Fork of Freenet
- Encrypts tunnels using NTCPv2 - an implementation of AES-256-CBC
- Each user/router has an inbound and outbound tunnel
- A message is received through your inbound tunnel and kept for you or passed on towards the destination through your outbound tunnel
- Like a heavily encrypted version of standard packet routing

## Zeronet
- P2P web-hosting service
- When accessing a site, the entire content is downloaded to you, you then host the site for others - **VERY DODGY** - can be done for distributing illegal content 
- Public and private keys are generated for the site and used to prove the integrity of the site, public key also used for identification - like Tor
