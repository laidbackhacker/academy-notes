## Vernam's Patent
- Developed the XOR concept for encryption
- `Plaintext XOR key = Ciphertext`
- `Ciphertext XOR key = Plaintext`
- Its reversible *if* you know the key

## Symmetric ciphers
Same key used to encrypt and decrypt

Examples include:
- RC4 (WEP, WPA)
- AES (EFS, BitLocker)
- 3DES (Outlook, EMV standard)
