# Operating systems
## Intro
- Operating systems are the middle man that allow the user to communicate with hardware in order to use software
- They are designed to make the computer easier to use, provide a user interface

## User interfaces
- Operating systems provide a user interface. They can be command line based or graphical.

## Drivers
- Drivers allow users to communicate with physical hardware. They allow hardware to control and be controlled by software

## Real-time OS
- Uses scheduling to make the operating system as quick and responsive as possible

## Multi-user OS
- Multiple users can access the system at the same time. Like a server or ATM mainframe.
- Needs to be concurrent, not like windows having multiple user accounts

## Multi-tasking
- Allows for multiple tasks to be executed at once.
### Pre-emptive
- Divides up CPU time to each program
### Co-operative
- Each process gives time to the other processes
