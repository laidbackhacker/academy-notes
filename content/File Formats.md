# Formatting drives
Hard drives are segmented into sectors, clusters and tracks

Files can fragmented and stored across lots of clusters

Over time this slows down read and write speeds, this is fixed by defragmenting a drive.
Disk defragmentation collects all of the fragments of a file and collects them into a single place.

**❗SSDs should never be defragmented❗**
